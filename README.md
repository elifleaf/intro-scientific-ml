## Course Blurb  

This is an introductory but graduate level course for students who are interested in data science/machine learning methods as applied to problems in Engineering and the Physical Sciences.  Largely because of my own background in stochastic methods and applied math, we will introduce the concepts from the perspective of probabilistic modeling and highlight the principles behind the methods. Course content will be split approximately evenly between theory and applications. 

Topics to be covered: 
+ (i) intro and review of probability theory (6 lectures - predictive modeling, basics, discrete and continuous random variables, collections of random variables, random vectors)
+ (ii) uncertainty propagation (4 lectures - sampling, Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo estimators, quantifying uncertainty)
+ (iii) Bayesian inference (2 lectures - selection of priors, some analytic examples)
+ (iv) supervised learning (4 lectures - linear and least squares regression, bayesian linear regression, classification)
+ (v) unsupervised learning (2 lectures - clustering, density estimation, dimensionality reduction)
+ (vi) state space models (2 lectures)
+ (v) Gaussian process regression (3 lectures - priors, conditioning, Bayesian global optimization)
+ (vi) neural networks (3 lectures - function approximation, deep, physics-informed)
+ (vii) sampling methods and variational inference (2 lectures). 

Expected outcomes: at the end of the course, you will be able to represent uncertainty in parameters in models, propagate uncertainty through physical models, solve basic supervised tasks (regression, classification, filtering), solve basic unsupervised tasks (clustering, dimensionality reduction, density estimation), design new models that by design include physical information and causal assumptions.  You will also gain skills in Python coding, loading and visualizing data in Jupyter notebooks, and use/recognize common Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) and software (pytorch, Tensorflow, jax).

## Office Hours and Course-Related Communication 

In-person office hours will be held ... 

I can be reached using the course slack at most other times, and will respond to questions as soon as I am able.  Please note that questions related to course content, homework, etc should be posted and shared with everyone as this is a small class and many of us will benefit from the discussion.

## Disclaimer 


This repository includes the source code for the course "ME 539 Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning," which is being taught during Fall 2024 by Dr. Alex Alberts at Purdue University.
The in-person version of the course meets every Tuesday and Thursday 4:30-5:45 pm at HAMP 2118.
Please only come to the room if registered, as there is insufficient physical space.
There is also a Purdue online version of the class and an [EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PurdueX+ME597x+2T2020/course/) version.

There are pre-recorded videos of all lectures.
These are accessible to Purdue students through [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login).
EdX students will find the same videos in EdX.
More details about the syllabus and course evaluations are available on the corresponding websites.

This course evolved from the ME 597 "Data Analytics for Scientists and Engineers," taught two times by Prof. Bilionis, and the ME 597/MA 598 "Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification," taught three times by Prof. Bilionis (the first time, Spring 2016 it was co-taught with Prof. Guang Lin).
If you are interested in accessing the old versions of the course, they can be found [here](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/uq-course).

Note that there is also a 1-credit undergraduate version of the course under ME 297, "Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers." This version can be found [here](https://github.com/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science).
